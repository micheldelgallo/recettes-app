# Recettes-APP
I did an example using ReactJS to show recipes from spoonacular API.
I used some technologies/frameworks like:
* Redux to a predictable state container. You can use Redux DevTools to see it working. 
* React-Semantic-UI to create beautiful and responsive layouts.

# Configuring .env File with the info API
* Create a .env file in the root with the content bellow:
    - `REACT_APP_SPOONACULAR_API=https://api.spoonacular.com`
    - `REACT_APP_SPOONACULAR_APIKEY=07bb25f704a04e35ae569b8bbe34d100`

# Install React Application
* Install and start the React Application
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`
